ElScreen-GF 1.0 README file

This is the distribution of ElScreen-GF 1.0, released  January 1997
with ElScreen 1.0. This is an EMACS interface to 'GNU id-utils'. It
works inside the ElScreen environment.

'GNU id-utils' is language-independent identifier database tool. This
stores tokens, literal numbers, or words of human-readable text.

them more easily. It will be helpful to you when you hack source
codes.

    o               Jump to the current entry
    v               Show ElScreen-GF version

Setup
-----
You can set the following variables:

    elscreen-gf-use-underline

        If non nil, underline is drawn on the selected entry in
        ElScreen-GF mode. The default value is 't'.

    elscreen-gf-mkid-always-recursive

        If non nil, 'elscreen-gf-mkid' does not ask whether recursive
        or not, and always runs recursively. The default value is 'nil'.

    elscreen-gf-entry-overlay-property
    elscreen-gf-entry-overlay-value

        After you jump to an entry, ElScreen-GF applies the overlay
        which these values specifies with the corresponding line. The
        default values are 'face' and 'highlight'. If you always use
        EMACS with '-nw' option, 'highlight' is hard to look at, so
		please add following line to your .emacs:

        (if (null (featurep 'hilit19))
            (setq elscreen-gf-entry-overlay-value 'bold))

    elscreen-gf-major-mode-alist

        The pairs of major-mode and regular expression of corresponding
        files. This alist is used as default value for mkid, grep, and
        so on.
