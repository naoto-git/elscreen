ElScreen 1.0 README file

This is the distribution of ElScreen 1.0, released January 1997.
It is an Emacs utility with which you can have multiple screens on
your GNU Emacs as well as GNU screen on shell. 

If you use emacs-lisp applications which have many windows(like gnus,
irchat, mew...)  ElScreen makes it easy to switch to a different
screen, with its configuration unchanged. You can also create and kill 
screen, jump to them, rename the screen, and so on.

This is tested on mule2.3, which is based on GNU Emacs 19.28.500 and
19.31.2.
