ElScreen 1.3.2 README file

This is the distribution of ElScreen 1.3.2, released August 2004. 
It is an Emacs utility with which you can have multiple screens
(window-configuration) on your GNU Emacs as well as GNU screen on 
terminal.

If you use emacs-lisp applications which have many windows (like
Gnus, irchat, Wanderlust, Mew...), ElScreen makes it easy to
switch to a different screen, with its configuration unchanged.
You can also create and kill screen, jump to them, rename the
screen, and so on.

This version is developed on Emacs 21.3.50, with APEL 10.6.
